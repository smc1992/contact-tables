// DEPRECATED: This script is conceptually flawed and should not be used.
// It attempts to manage user passwords directly in the public.profiles table,
// which bypasses Supabase's auth.users table and security mechanisms.

// Password updates must be handled through the Supabase Auth interface or API.

console.warn('This script (update-admin-password.js) is deprecated and should not be run.');
